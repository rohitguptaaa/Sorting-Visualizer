# Sorting Algorithm Visualizer (Java)

A Java Swing–based application that visually demonstrates how different sorting algorithms work in real time.  
This project helps in understanding sorting logic through animations, comparisons, and step-by-step execution.

---

## 🚀 Features

- Visual representation of sorting algorithms
- Adjustable array size using a slider
- Real-time animation with delays for better understanding
- Displays current algorithm, comparisons, and process updates
- User-friendly GUI built using Java Swing

---

## 🧠 Algorithms Implemented

- Bubble Sort  
- Selection Sort  
- Insertion Sort  
- Merge Sort  
- Quick Sort  

*(Algorithms are visualized using bars representing array elements)*
